Here collect my programs for analyzing the beads assay in the bacterial flagellar motor experiment.

Features:
-  Automatic recognition of the rotating beads in the video file.
-  Batch process for the same type of files in the assigned folder.
-  Draw the trace of the rotating trace and show the FFT results.
-  Output the results in a CSV file, including speed, FFT peak, and ellipse fitting quality for further data filtration.
